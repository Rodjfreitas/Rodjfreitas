Hello, welcome to my profile.
I am from Belo Horizonte, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. I'm 34 years old, Married to Nat√°lia and I don't have children or animals.
I have always been passionate about technologies, and this passion brought me closer to programming. I am currently doing a professional mentorship to develop my skills as a programmer, discover my strengths and weaknesses, develop and improve them. I decided to specialize in front-end and that has been very rewarding.
I seek to be the best professional, capable of working with demands, news, surpassing myself every day.
I believe that a great professional is one who knows no limits, who is capable of overcoming the barriers that prevent him from growing every day, and that's me!
